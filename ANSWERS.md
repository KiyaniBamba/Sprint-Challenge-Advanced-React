- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?
class component are more pratical to use with data persistances and  if we want to use lifecycle methods.


- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.
componentDimount, shouldComponentUpdate and componentWillUnmount are three methodes parts of the React lifecycle. 

componentDidMount() runs after the first-render of the component, componentDidUpdate() runs everytime the component's props or state changes and componentWillUnmount() runs before the component is removed from the DOM.


- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?
Custom hook allow us to apply non-visual behavior and stateful logic throughout our components by reusing the same hook over and over again.


- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?

Testing is essential for software quality. Some of the benefit are :
-Surfaces bugs faster.
-Help team collaboration.
-Acts as a safety net when making changes or when we go back to our code several weeks after writtin it.
-Acts as documentation for the code.
-Encourages us to write more testable (better!) code.
